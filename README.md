# Machine Learning - Activities
This repository contains the activities I personally done during the course **Machine Learning** as part of the Masterâ€™s Degree in **Computer Science** at UniPD, taught by Professor Fabio Aiolli for the academic year 2024/2025.

## Activity 1 - Decision Tree
Given a very simple dataset provided by the professor I built a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm.

## Activity 2 - Ridge Regression
Implementation of Ridge Regression using `sklearn`, where we observe how different alpha values influence the plotted models.

## Activity 3 - Decision Tree
This is exercise 3.2 from Mitchell's book (1997), where I calculated the entropy and information gain for a specific label.
